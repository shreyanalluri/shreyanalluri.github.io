title: About Me
---

I’m a bioinformatician deeply committed to leveraging data science for social good. My work focuses on large-scale multiomics and women’s health, where I’m driven by the potential to make a real difference through personalized medicine. I’m passionate about using my expertise to uncover insights that can improve lives and bring about meaningful change in healthcare. Every day, I strive to learn more, push boundaries, and contribute to a future where data empowers us all.

# A few more things about me
- In my 5+ years in biological research, and 3+ years in biostatistics/bioinformatics, I have developed a the first and only serum biomarker clinical test for biliary atresia, streamlined various high throughput assays, and identified potential therapeutic targets for a range of neurological disorders.
- I learned to code while working in my wet lab, frustrated with our old school lab equipment ordering system (leaving post-its on my desk that would inevitable fly away and get lost before I saw them). I created an app using Javascript and Python to create an ordering and lab inventory system custom (and free!) to our lab.
- I grew up in Mason, a small city in the suburbs of Cincinnati, Ohio.
- I'm an avid home cook and baker. I love nerding out about food science and weird flavor combinations.

# My current favorites 
- Book: Daughter of the Moon Goddess by Sue Lynn Tan
- Food: Shake Shack cheese fries 
- Cafe: Maruichi Select (their matcha is the best matcha in Boston)
- Activity: Meandering around Boston
